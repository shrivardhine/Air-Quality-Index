🌍 Air Quality Metrics Dashboard - Power BI 📊

I’m excited to share my recent project: a comprehensive Air Quality Metrics Dashboard developed using Power BI. This interactive dashboard visualizes key air quality indicators, helping users understand pollution levels across various cities and make data-driven decisions.



📈 Key Metrics: Average PM2.5: 67.45 µg/m³ Average NO: 17.57 µg/m³ Average CO: 2.25 µg/m³ Average SO₂: 14.53 µg/m³ Average AQI: 166.46



🚀 Key Features Include:

Top 3 Least Polluted Cities 🌱

This feature highlights the cities with the lowest pollution levels, providing a benchmark for areas leading in air quality.

Top 3 Polluted Cities 🌪️

The bar chart clearly identifies the most polluted cities, enabling stakeholders to prioritize interventions for improved air quality.

AQI Trend Overview 📅

This visualization tracks the fluctuations in the Air Quality Index over time, offering insights into seasonal trends and long-term pollution patterns.

Area-wise AQI Overview 🌍

An interactive map that visualizes AQI values across different geographic areas, helping users pinpoint regions with critical air quality issues.

Average NO & NO₂ by City 🚦

By analyzing nitrogen oxides (NO & NO₂), this feature provides a deeper understanding of urban air pollution sources and their impact on air quality.

PM10 by Month 📊

The line graph showcases the monthly variation in particulate matter (PM10), giving a clear picture of air pollution trends throughout the year.



📝 Summary: This Power BI dashboard transforms complex air quality data into intuitive visual insights, empowering users to monitor pollution levels effectively. The interactive design makes it a valuable tool for environmental analysis and policy-making. With a focus on actionable insights, this dashboard is perfect for businesses, researchers, and policymakers dedicated to improving air quality. 

🌟 Explore the impact of pollution and take data-driven steps towards a cleaner future! 🌿
